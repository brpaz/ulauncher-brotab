## Requirements

* Python >= 3

Before installing this extension make sure you have [Brotab](https://github.com/balta2ar/brotab) installed and working as specified on their README. Otherwise this extension won¬¥t work.

You also need to have some Python packages installed on your system.

You can do so, by running the following command:

```sh
pip install --user memoization==0.4.0
```

In some systems, you might need to run `pip3` instead of `pip`.

## Install

Open ulauncher preferences window -> extensions -> add extension and paste the following url:

```
https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-brotab
```

## Usage

Use the keyword **brotab** to list your tabs. Clicking on an item will switch the browser to the specified active tab)

You can also close existing tabs by using `cl`, `cltab` or `cttab` keywords instead of `brotab`


## Development

```
git clone https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-brotab
make link
```

The `make link` command will symlink the cloned repo into the appropriate location on the ulauncher extensions folder.

To see your changes, stop ulauncher and run it from the command line with: `make dev`.

The output will display something like this:

```
